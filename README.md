# scoped-store-todo-demo
A ToDo implementation using ScopedStore.

To show how to use ScopedStore, this demonstration does not use props, provider/injects, and VueX, which are the basic state-sharing methods provided by Vue.

Through this demonstration, I hope you get some ideas of using ScopedStore in practice.
